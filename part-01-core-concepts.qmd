## Input, output, pipes

The introduction covers `stdin` and `stdout`, how to combine these commands with `ls`, `less`, and the pipe (`|`):

> __`stdin`__: The stream of input that Linux reads from your keyboard.
>
> __`stdout`__: The stream of output that Linux writes to your display. 

```{bash}
ls -l ex/ch01
```

In the `ex/ch01/command_1_wc` folder, you'll see `myfile`. If we run `less` on `myfile`, we see the file displayed one screenful at a time:

```{bash}
less ex/ch01/command_1_wc/myfile
```

## Combining Commands 

> "*You can connect the `stdout` of one command to the `stdin` of another, so the first command feeds the second.*"

We can connect `ls -l` and `less` using the pipe: 

```{bash}
ls -l ex/ch01/command_1_wc | less
```

List the contents of a large directory with `ls -l`, then pass this to `less` to make it more human readable.

> "*You can connect these two commands because `ls` writes to `stdout` and `less` can read from `stdin`.*"

This chapter covers an intro to six common Linux commands: 

```{bash}
pwd
```

```{bash}
whoami
```
